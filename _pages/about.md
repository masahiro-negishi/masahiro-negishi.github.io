A first-year master's student at [SYI Lab](http://www.ms.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index.html) of the University of Tokyo. Current research interests include:
- developing disentangled representation learning algorithms for real-world problems
- applying category theory to machine learning
- integrating causality into machine learning, especially for out-of-distribution generalization
- applying machine learning to symbolic regression

I love reading SF. I highly recommend "[The Three-Body Problem](https://www.amazon.co.jp/Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu/dp/178497157X)" by Cixin Liu (and his other works are also unquestionably masterpieces). When reading SF, the best drink is tea, especially I love fruit tea. Lately, I have been really into working out and jogging. After all, vitality is all you need for master's students.
