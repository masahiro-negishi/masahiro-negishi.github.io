A second-year master's student at [SYI Lab](http://www.ms.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index.html) of the University of Tokyo. Current research interests include:
- explainable AI
- disentangled representation learning
- graph representation learning
- AI for Climate Change, including creating environmentally friendly materials for batteries or buildings, and detecting illegal deforestation utilizing remote sensing, among other things

I love reading SF. I highly recommend "[The Three-Body Problem](https://www.amazon.co.jp/Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu/dp/178497157X)" by Cixin Liu (and his other works are also unquestionably masterpieces). When reading SF, the best drink is tea, especially I love fruit tea. Lately, I have been really into working out and jogging.
