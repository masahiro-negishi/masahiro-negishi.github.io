A second-year master's student at [SYI Lab](http://www.ms.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index.html) of the University of Tokyo. Current research interests include:
- Generative models for crystals
- OOD generalization
- Extracting scientific knowledge from neural networks
- Graph representation learning

I love to read books. Some of my favorites are:
- "[The Three-Body Problem](https://www.amazon.co.jp/Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu/dp/178497157X)" by Cixin Liu (and his other works are also unquestionably masterpieces), 
- "[Space Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Brothers_(manga))" by Chuya Koyama,
- "[How to Do Nothing](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/600671/how-to-do-nothing-by-jenny-odell/)" by Jenny Odell.

Lately, I have been really into working out and jogging.
