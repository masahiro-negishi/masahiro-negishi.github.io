I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Materials at Imperial College London.
My supervisor is Professor [Aron Walsh](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/a.walsh), and I am a member of the [Materials Design Group](https://wmd-group.github.io/).
I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science from the University of Tokyo.

Current research interests include:
- Inverse design of crystals using generative models, reinforcement learning, and other machine learning techniques
- Evaluation metrics for inverse design of materials

I love to read books. Some of my favorites are:
- "[The Three-Body Problem](https://www.amazon.co.jp/Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu/dp/178497157X)" by Cixin Liu (and his other works are also unquestionably masterpieces),
- "[Space Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Brothers_(manga))" by Chuya Koyama,
- "[How to Do Nothing](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/600671/how-to-do-nothing-by-jenny-odell/)" by Jenny Odell.

Lately, I have been really into working out and jogging.
