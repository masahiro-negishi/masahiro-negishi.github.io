## 1. Introduction
With the recent widespread adoption of AI technologies, lively debates have emerged regarding the associated risks. These discussions span a spectrum from concerns about AI replacing jobs to the potential threat of autonomous robots causing harm to humans. However, these debates often remain superficial, particularly among the general public, as terms like "AI" or "Risk" carry vague meanings. Seeking a deeper understanding of the current landscape of AI risks and exploring effective approaches to address them, I participated in an enlightening educational workshop on Responsible AI for Peace and Security in Malm√∂, Sweden, held on November 16 and 17, 2023. This post aims to distill the insights gained during the two-day workshop, hoping to contribute to a clearer perspective on the challenges posed by AI risks. This post mainly focuses on AI risks for peace and security.

### Definitions of Peace and Security
To begin, let's delve into the definitions of "Peace" and "Security." Both terms carry conventional and contemporary interpretations. Here, we present the definitions of Peace:

- Conventional Peace (Negative Peace): Denotes the absence of conflicts.
- Contemporary Peace (Positive Peace): Encompasses the establishment of sustainable societies where individuals experience dignity, equality, and safety.

Now, let's explore the definitions of Security:

- Conventional Security (Objective Security): Signifies the state of not being threatened.
- Contemporary Security (Subjective Security): Involves feeling confident and free from danger.

As evident, significant overlaps exist between Peace and Security, leading to the standard reference to the two concepts as "Peace and Security." One pivotal distinction between conventional and contemporary definitions lies in the fact that the former primarily centers on P&S among nations, whereas the latter extends its scope to individuals. In simpler terms, when we engage in discussions about P&S today, it is common to contemplate Peace and Security on the individual citizen's level.
