This post is about what I learned in an educational workshop on Responsible AI for Peace and Security, held in Malmö, Sweden on 16 and 17 November, 2023.

## 1. Introduction
With the recent widespread adoption of AI technologies, lively debates have emerged regarding the associated risks. These discussions span a spectrum from concerns about AI replacing jobs to the potential threat of autonomous robots causing harm to humans. However, these debates often remain superficial, particularly among the general public, as terms like "AI" or "Risk" carry vague meanings. Seeking a deeper understanding of the current landscape of AI risks and exploring effective approaches to address them, I participated in an enlightening educational workshop on Responsible AI for Peace and Security in Malmö, Sweden, held on November 16 and 17, 2023. This post aims to distill the insights gained during the two-day workshop, hoping to contribute to a clearer perspective on the challenges posed by AI risks.
