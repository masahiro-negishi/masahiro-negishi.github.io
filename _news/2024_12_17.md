I presented a poster at [the ML and the Physical Sciences workshop](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2024/) at NeurIPS 2024. The work is about a new coefficient estimation method for symbolic regression. Here is [the poster](https://neurips.cc/media/PosterPDFs/NeurIPS%202024/100013.png?t=1731137395.5302327) and [the paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=gIscWmLoYf).
