I attended the 12th Research Area meeting [CREST](https://www.jst.go.jp/kisoken/crest/en/project/1111098/1111098_2018.html) "Symbiotic Interaction" held in Osaka from 9/28 to 9/30. I presented a poster "Unified Definition of Disentanglement and Derived Metrics" on behalf of [my colleagure](https://yivan.xyz/about).

I did a poster presentation for the first time. Although most attendees did not have a background in machine learning, I successfully conveyed to them the importance of our theoretical machine learning research. I improved my presentation skills a lot. Additionally, I had a fruitful and inspiring discussion with many researchers.
