Starting today, until July 31st, I will be staying at [TU Wien's ML Research Unit](https://ml-tuw.github.io/) as a research student. My superviser is Professor Thomas GÃ¤rtner. Here, I will be working on research in interpretable graph representation learning!
I have started a research internship at the [PRADA Lab](https://pradalab1.github.io/index.html) at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology. I am working on generative models for crystals under the supervision of Professor Di Wang.
