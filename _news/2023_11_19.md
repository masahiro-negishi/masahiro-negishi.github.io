I attended [an educational workshop on Responsible AI for Peace and Security](https://ibisml.org/ibis2023/) held in Malmö, Sweden on 16 and 17 November 2023. The workshop was organized by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute([SIPRI](https://www.sipri.org/)) and the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs([UNODA](https://disarmament.unoda.org/)).

***

In the workshop, I learned the following topics:

- How AI development/diffusion can generate risk for peace and security.

- How to mitigate AI-related risks for peace and security.

- What responsible innovation of AI is.

- Possible risk scenarios.

I plan to provide a detailed blog post about the workshop later. Additionally, I'll be sharing a blog post about my experiences in Malmö and Copenhagen.
