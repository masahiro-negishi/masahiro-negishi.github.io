I presented a poster at ICML 2025. In this work, we analyze the distance between the embeddings of Message Passing Neural Networks by distilling it into our more interpretable distance. Here is [the poster](https://icml.cc/media/PosterPDFs/ICML%202025/44188.png?t=1751027817.0632403) and [the paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=lflqQWP1jy).
