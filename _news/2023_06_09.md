I participated in [the 37th Annual Conference of the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ai-gakkai.or.jp/jsai2023/en) held in Kumamoto from 6/6 to 6/9. I did an oral presentation about our paper "Scaling Laws of Dataset Size for VideoGPT", which was the first oral presentation at a conference for me.
